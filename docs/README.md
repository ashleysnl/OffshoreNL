# Puffin Platform Panic!

A static, retro pixel-arcade browser game built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Run locally (no build tools)
1. Download or clone the project folder.
2. Open `index.html` by double-clicking it.
3. Press **Start Shift**.

Notes:
- Everything is generated in code (Canvas + WebAudio).
- No external assets, no bundlers, no Node.js.

## Controls
- **Start Shift**: begin a new run.
- **Pause / Resume**: pause the current run.
- **Restart**: start over immediately.
- Action buttons:
  - Fix Equipment
  - Clear Iceberg
  - Brew Coffee
  - Calm Crew
  - Shoo Puffins
  - Start Backup Generator

Goal:
- Keep **Production**, **Safety**, and **Morale** above zero.
- Survive as long as possible while handling random offshore chaos events.

## Saved data
Uses `localStorage` to save:
- Best score
- Settings (`Sound`, `CRT`)

Use **Reset Data** to clear saved values.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages (beginner steps)
1. Create a new GitHub repository (for example: `puffin-platform-panic`).
2. Upload all project files/folders exactly as provided:
   - `index.html`
   - `css/`
   - `js/`
   - `docs/`
3. In GitHub, open the repo **Settings** tab.
4. Open **Pages** in the left sidebar.
5. Under **Build and deployment**:
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main** (or `master`), folder: **/ (root)**
6. Click **Save**.
7. Wait ~1-3 minutes, then open the URL shown in Pages settings.

## Troubleshooting
### 404 page on GitHub Pages
- Confirm `index.html` is in repo root, not inside another folder.
- Confirm Pages is set to deploy from the correct branch and root folder.
- Wait a few minutes and refresh.

### Blank screen
- Open browser DevTools Console and check for file path errors.
- Ensure file/folder names match case exactly (`js/main.js` is not `js/Main.js`).
- Hard refresh to clear cache:
  - macOS: `Cmd + Shift + R`
  - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + F5`

### Game loads but buttons do nothing
- Click once anywhere to unlock audio context on mobile/some browsers.
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled.

### Changes not appearing after redeploy
- Browser cache can serve older files; force refresh.
- Verify the updated commit is on the branch GitHub Pages is using.

## Technical notes
- Fixed virtual resolution: `320x180`.
- Pixel rendering: `ctx.imageSmoothingEnabled = false` and CSS `image-rendering: pixelated`.
- Arcade loop: `requestAnimationFrame`.
- Sound effects: generated by WebAudio oscillators.
